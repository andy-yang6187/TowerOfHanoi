# TowerOfHanoi
Python ASCII visualization of Tower of Hanoi Algorithm

This program serves as a test for the recursive algorithm to solve Tower of Hanoi. 

Users can insert any number of rings, and the algorithm will solve the game.

The goal of the game is to move the rings into the same configuration, except on peg C by moving the rings one by one according to the following rules:

* You can only move one ring each time you make a move.
* Smaller radius rings can never be below larger radius rings.
* When you move a ring, you can only take the ring at the top of the peg and drop it to the top of another peg.
